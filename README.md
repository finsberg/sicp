# SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) 


SICP is computer science course taught by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman at MIT in the late 1980s.

In this repo I will try to solve some of the exercises and provide some lecture notes for MIT SICP course.

I will aslo use this as an opurtunity to learn [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) which is a dialect of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))
